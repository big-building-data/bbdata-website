# BBData Website

This is a simple Website to show the advantages and Projects of BBData but also to help developers to get started with BBData.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server on the address: http://localhost:3000/

### Build

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment
The deployment is done with Netlify. A push on the `master` branch publishes the production version on https://bbdata-website.netlify.app

### Contribute
The development is ongoing, and there are many new features that we want to add. We welcome pull requests and issues on github.
